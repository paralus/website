## Hello world

We are thrilled to announce Name, an Open Source Zero Trust Kubectl Access (ZTKA) project.

## What's it about?

Name helps you manage access to all your Kubernetes clusters.
It is the single platform that you need to manage access to your Kubernetes clusters hosted on public cloud, enterprise cloud or even on prem. From configuring time-based access to dynamically revoking permissions, Name provides you fine grained options for access control.
It can seamlessly integrate with your existing SSO and Identity provider. It comes with an intuitive dashboard and a CLI to help perform these tasks.
