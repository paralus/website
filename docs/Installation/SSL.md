Paralus uses domain based routing for zero trust kubectl access (ZTKA) and hence a domain name is required to access the Paralus dashboard. This document lists the steps to enable SSL for Paralus.

## Overview

Enabling SSL can be done using different tools and ways. For the purpose of explaining how it works with Paralus, we will assume that you have installed Paralus with default settings. If you’ve followed any of our quick start guides to deploy Paralus, these steps will work.

Before we get into the actual steps, here’s an overview of the steps to be performed along with the tools used:

1. Install Paralus
2. Install LetsEncrypt Cert Manager - _you can use any other similar tool_
3. Deploy ClusterIssuer & Certificate Objects
4. Update annotations in HttpProxy


Let’s discuss each of the steps in detail.

## Steps to Enable SSL in Paralus

### Install Paralus

Based on the environment that you are using, you can refer to our [installation documentation](../installation) to install Paralus.

### Install cert-manger

cert-manager is a tool that adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates. Read more about [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager).

While it supports helm installation, we’ll use the yaml file provided

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.5.4/cert-manager.yaml
```

This will install all the required components and CRDs in a new namespace. To validate the installation, run the following command:

```sh
$ kubectl -n cert-manager get all

NAME                                       	     READY    STATUS	 RESTARTS  	AGE

replicaset.apps/cert-manager-webhook-7b4c5f579b  	    1     	1     	  1   	17s
```

### Deploy ClusterIssuer and Certificate Objects

cert-manager supports two different CRDs for configuration:

* `Issuer`, which is scoped to a single namespace
* `ClusterIssuer` which is scoped to an entire cluster

Paralus is installed in a separate namespace, if you want to create a single `Issuer` that can be consumed in multiple namespaces, you should consider creating a `ClusterIssuer` resource. This is almost identical to the Issuer resource, however this is non-namespaced so it can be used to issue certificates across all namespaces

> Note: Our default Paralus installation assumes that it is the only deployed application on a cluster and there are no other ingress, cert-issuers etc. present. In case you have multiple other ingresses present, you should use `Issuer` instead and deploy it on the same namespace as Paralus. Read more: [Difference between Issuer and ClusterIssuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/#namespaces)

Create a file called `letsencrypt-prod.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
 name: letsencrypt-prod
 namespace: cert-manager
spec:
 acme:
   email: user@email.com
   privateKeySecretRef:
     name: letsencrypt-prod
   server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
   solvers:
   - http01:
       ingress:
         class: contour
```

> replace the email with your email id. This is used by Let’s Encrypt to communicate with you.

We are using `letsencrypt-prod` directly instead of `letsencrypt-staging`. The difference between letsencrypt staging and production is that the CA is production is trusted while the staging CA isn’t. You can read more about [letsencrypt here](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/).

Apply this file and deploy the `ClusterIssuer` object

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f letsencrypt-prod.yaml
clusterissuer.cert-manager.io/letsencrypt-prod created
```

It takes a few seconds for the ClusterIssuer to be active, you can check whether it’s active or not using the following command

```sh
$ kubectl get clusterissuer letsencrypt-prod

NAME                  READY   AGE
letsencrypt-prod      True    54s

```

Once the ClusterIssuer is ready, we create a certificate object. Create a new file `cert.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
 name: consoleparalus
 namespace: paralus
spec:
 commonName: console.paralusdemo.com
 dnsNames:
 - console.paralusdemo.com
 issuerRef:
   name: letsencrypt-prod
   kind: ClusterIssuer
 secretName: consoleparalus
```

Provide the FQDN of your Paralus deployment for `commonName` and `dnsNames`. You can get the name with this command `kubectl get httpproxy --all-namespaces` and provide the FQDN name console.

Apply this certificate using the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f cert.yaml
```

It will take a while for the certificate to deploy. It also creates a secret with the certificate details that will be used by the http proxy to enable secured communication.

```sh
$kubectl get certificate --all-namespaces

NAMESPACE   NAME         	  READY   SECRET       	  AGE
paralus 	consoleparalus    True	consoleparalus    17s
```

It also creates a secret that will be passed on to the httpproxy

```sh
kubectl get secrets -n paralus

NAME                TYPE               DATA   AGE
consoleparalus      kubernetes.io/tls   2  	  1m
```

At this point, our Issuer is ready along with the certificate. It’s time to configure our httpproxy to use the generated certificate.

### Update annotations in HttpProxy

The final step is to edit annotations and TLS values in the console httpproxy.

Add the following as part of annotation:

```yaml
…
cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
…
```

Update the virtualhost and add tls along with the secretName

```yaml
…
 virtualhost:
	fqdn: console.paralusdemo.com
	tls:
  	secretName: consoleparalus
…
```

Make these changes and save the file. If all the configuration is done correctly, the httpproxy will be updated with the provided TLS. You can confirm that with the following command:

```sh
$ kubectl get httpproxy --all-namespaces

NAMESPACE   NAME              	      FQDN                           	  TLS SECRET   	  STATUS   STATUS DESCRIPTION
paralus 	console           	    console.paralusdemo.com        	    consoleparalus    valid	    Valid HTTPProxy
paralus 	ztka-core-connector     *.core-connector.paralusdemo.com                      valid	    Valid HTTPProxy
paralus 	ztka-user         	    *.user.paralusdemo.com                                valid	    Valid HTTPProxy
```

At this point when you access the Paralus dashboard, you should be able to see the padlock in the address bar which confirms that SSL has been successfully enabled for Paralus.
