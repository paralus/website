One of the best things that comes with Paralus is that it can be easily deployed to virtually any Kubernetes cluster. We have shown that in our previous blog posts where we deployed Paralus on [GKE](/blog/paralus-quickstart-gke/), [Kind](/blog/kind-quickstart/) and even [MicroK8s](/blog/paralus-quickstart-microk8s/).

In this blog post, we'll take you through the steps to setup Paralus on Digital Ocean (DO) using a custom domain and import a local cluster into it. Let's get started!

**Note:** Before you start the installation process, do check out the [pre-requisites for installing Paralus](/docs/installation#prerequisites).

## Pre Requisites

To setup Paralus on Digital Ocean there are a few things that need to done:

- A Digital Ocean account - _you can [register for a Free Digital Ocean account](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new) if you don't have one_
- A Domain Name - _with permission to manage DNS settings._
- Helm

We'll start with setting up a cluster on Digital Ocean, followed by deploying Paralus to it using helm charts. Once the installation is done, we'll configure the DNS settings for the domain for Paralus to work. After that we'll login to the Paralus dashboard and import a Kubernetes cluster that is running on a local laptop.

## Creating Digital Ocean Cluster

Creating a Kubernetes cluster on DO is quite simple. DO offers just one type of Kubernetes cluster and not a variety of offerings like GKE, AWS or AKS. They provide two types of plans when it comes to Nodes - **Basic** and **Professional** plans, each of them offering a different configuration.

You need to choose the professional node plan with **3 nodes** at the minimum for Paralus to run smoothly.

Login to your DO account and choose **Kubernetes** -> **Create Kubernetes Cluster** and provide details like cluster name, region, Kubernetes version, capacity etc.

To know more about how to choose a plan or resize a Kubernetes cluster, check out [this document](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/concepts/choosing-a-plan/).

## Connecting to Digital Ocean Cluster

To connect to your newly created Kubernetes cluster there are two things that you need to do:

1. Create API Token
2. Configure doctl

### 1. Create API Token

You need to generate an API key to be able to access your Kubernetes cluster. You can follow this guide to [create a personal access token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/).

### 2. Configure doctl

The next step is to configure `doctl` - a CLI tool provided by DO to interact with their API via command line.

We used a snap package to install the doctl package on our Ubuntu laptop.

> Refer to [doctl installation document](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/) to install it on different environment.

`sudo snap install doctl`

Create new context by providing the API token generated in the earlier step and switch to this newly created context

`doctl auth init --context <NAME>` followed by `doctl auth switch --context <NAME>`

Allow `doctl` to access the kube-config that will allow you to communicate with the Kubernetes cluster.

`sudo snap connect doctl:kube-config`

The next step is to configure a certificate to your kubectl configuration. You will get this certificate details after your cluster has been provisioned.

<img src="/img/docs/digitalocean-04.png" alt="Adding certificate for doctl" height="70%" width="70%"/>

```bash
doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save f4739f01-1433-48e1-b991-742a53769fe7

Notice: Adding cluster credentials to kubeconfig file found in "/home/atulpriya/.kube/config"
Notice: Setting current-context to do-ams3-paralus-demo
```

Once done, you can validate the connectivity using the following command

```bash
kubectl get nodes

NAME                   STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
pool-lhosbqych-7fomd   Ready    <none>   16m   v1.23.9
pool-lhosbqych-7fomi   Ready    <none>   16m   v1.23.9
pool-lhosbqych-7fomv   Ready    <none>   16m   v1.23.9
```

At this point, you have successfully created a Kubernetes cluster & configured access to it using `doctl`. The next steps include installing Paralus and importing a local cluster on to it.

## Installing Paralus

In the same terminal, you can follow the below steps to deploy Paralus to your DO cluster.

1. Add helm repo

   `helm repo add paralus https://paralus.github.io/helm-charts`

2. Install Paralus

  ```bash
   helm install myrelease paralus/ztka \
    -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paralus/helm-charts/main/examples/values.dev-generic.yaml \
    --set fqdn.domain="chartexample.com" \
    -n paralus \
    --create-namespace
  ```

  > Note: If you're installing this in a **production environment**, please use [values.yaml](https://github.com/paralus/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/ztka/values.yaml) and configure the values mentioned [here](https://github.com/paralus/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/ztka#values) as required.

  > Note: Since v0.1.9, elasticsearch is an optional component. By default, Paralus will use database (Postgres) as the auditlog storage component. If you're doing a fresh install, below are the values.yaml file that you must pass during installation:

     - Postgres (_default_): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paralus/helm-charts/main/examples/values.dev-generic.yaml
     - Elasticsearch: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paralus/helm-charts/main/examples/values.elasticsearch.yaml

  ```bash
  NAME: myrelease
  LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Aug 29 17:29:54 2022
  NAMESPACE: paralus
  STATUS: deployed
  REVISION: 1
  NOTES:
    Access the application URL by running these commands:
    Get the EXTERNAL-IP value using following command:
    kubectl get service myrelease-contour-envoy -n paralus

    Add DNS records of following domains such that it resolves to above address:
    - console.chartexample.com
    - *.core-connector.chartexample.com
    - *.user.chartexample.com

    Open http://console.chartexample.com in browser.

    Note: If you are using a cluster with no load-balancer, then the address will be "<pending>".
          If it is Kind or Minikube cluster, check out respective docs to get the external address.

    You can view the default password for admin@paralus.local by running the following command once all the pods are running:

    kubectl logs -f --namespace paralus $(kubectl get pods --namespace paralus -l app.kubernetes.io/name='paralus' -o jsonpath='{ .items[0].metadata.name }') initialize | grep 'Org Admin default password:'
  ```

> Note: It can take upto a few minutes before all the pods are running and you can access the dashboard. You can check the status using `watch kubectl get pods -n paralus`

## Configuring DNS Settings

Once the installation is complete, you need to first get the external IP address provided by the loadbalancer. You can do so by executing the following command:

```bash
kubectl get svc myrelease-contour-envoy -n paralus

NAME                      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                      AGE
myrelease-contour-envoy   LoadBalancer   10.245.58.69   138.68.122.180   80:32722/TCP,443:32656/TCP   2m32s

```

> It may take some time for the loadbalancer to assign the IP address.

Note down the `EXTERNAL-IP` address for the `<releasename>-contour-envoy` service.

Navigate to your domain's DNS setting page. _The steps for changing DNS settings will vary based on your domain name provider._

While you are on your DNS Setting page, for the selected domain name, you need to add three A records. These will be based on the subdomains provided in the notes section post installation.

| Type | Address | Resolves To | TTL |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | console.chartexample.com | 138.68.122.180 | 1 Hour |
| A | *.core-connector.chartexample.com | 138.68.122.180 | 1 Hour |
| A | *.user.chartexample.com | 138.68.122.180 | 1 Hour |

### Resetting Default Password

Paralus comes configured with default credentials that allow you to access the dashboard.

In order to get the default passowrd, copy the command displayed after helm install and execute it

```bash
kubectl logs -f --namespace paralus $(kubectl get pods --namespace paralus -l app.kubernetes.io/name='paralus' -o jsonpath='{ .items[0].metadata.name }') initialize | grep 'Org Admin default password:'

Org Admin default password: 8[&C2(74^
```

In a new browser window/tab navigate to `http://console.chartexample.com` and log in with the following credentials:

- username: `admin@paralus.local` - _or the one you specified in `values.yaml`_
- password: `<generated above>`

It will ask you to change the default password. Please provide new set of passwords to proceed. If successful, you'll be redirected to the projects page where you'll see a default project.

### Importing Existing Cluster

Everything in Paralus is grouped into [Projects](/docs/usage/projects). Each project will have [clusters](/docs/usage/clusters), [users](/docs/usage/users) and [groups](/docs/usage/groups) associated with it. Hence the first step it to create a new project.

Click on **New Project** to create a new project and then import a cluster in that project. The cluster we are importing is a minikube cluster hosted on my laptop.

<img src="/img/docs/paralus-import-cluster-1.png" alt="Create New Cluster" height="70%" width="70%"/>

Click **Continue** and download the bootstrap yaml file by clicking **Import Bootstrap YAML**. This will download the YAML file that is required to connect your cluster with Paralus.

<img src="/img/docs/paralus-import-cluster-2.png" alt="Download Bootstrap YAML file" height="70%" width="70%"/>

Apply the bootstrap configuration yaml file

```bash
kubectl apply -f mylocalcluster.yaml
```

Wait for the changes to take place. On the dashboard you will see that the cluster is imported successfully. It usually takes 3-5 minutes for the status to update.

<img src="/img/docs/paralus-import-cluster-3.png" alt="Import Cluster Success" height="70%" width="70%"/>

Select your newly imported cluster and click on `kubectl` to access the prompt and interact with your cluster from the dashboard.

A `kubectl` console will open in the bottom half of the screen, enter your kubectl commands to interact with your cluster.
