In the previous blog posts we showed how you can set up Paralus on various cloud based Kubernetes clusters like [Azure](/blog/paralus-quickstart-aks/), [AWS](/blog/eks-quickstart) and [GCP](/blog/paralus-quickstart-gke). We also shared a tutorial on setting up Paralus on a [Kind](/blog/kind-quickstart) cluster.

All these posts have helped people get started with Paralus. However, there have been requests for details on **how to set up Paralus on MicroK8s cluster**. In this blog post, we do exactly that.

<!--truncate-->

In this tutorial we'll show you how to setup Paralus on a local Microk8s clusters along with all the configurations that are required.

## MicroK8s

MicroK8s is a light weight Kubernetes offering for developers, software vendors and DevOps folks. It can run on any system including laptops, servers and IoT devices like Raspberry Pi. It is one of the smallest, fastest & easily configurable Kubernetes offering out there. Refer to [MicroK8s documentation](https://microk8s.io/docs) to know more about it.

### Installing and Configuring MicroK8s

If you don't already have MicroK8s installed on your local system, you can do so by following the [MicroK8s Installation Guide](https://microk8s.io/docs/getting-started).

To check the status of your MicroK8s installation, run the following command:

```bash
microk8s status --wait-ready

microk8s is running
high-availability: no
  datastore master nodes: 127.0.0.1:19001
  datastore standby nodes: none

    storage              # (core) Alias to hostpath-storage add-on, deprecated
```

As mentioned, this is a light weight offering and hence a lot of addons are disabled by default. We need to enable a few of them to be able to run Paralus. In this case we need to enable `dns`, `hostpath-storage` and `metallb`, you can do so by running the enable command:

```bash
sudo microk8s enable dns hostpath-storage

Infer repository core for addon dns
Infer repository core for addon hostpath-storage

```

While configuring `metabllb` load balancer, it will ask you to provide a range of IP addresses that can be used to serve Paralus. So based on the IP address range provided by your DHCP server, you can provide the IP addresses accordingly.

```bash
sudo microk8s enable metallb

Infer repository core for addon metallb
Enabling MetalLB

```

> Note: The above IP address range that is provided is for sandbox/local environment only. For a production setup, you will need valid IP addresses for metallb to work correctly.

At this point, you have successfully configured MicroK8s and can proceed to install Paralus

### Installing Paralus

Add the [paralus helm repository](https://github.com/paralus/helm-charts)

```bash
helm repo add paralus https://paralus.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

```bash
   helm install myrelease paralus/ztka \
    -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paralus/helm-charts/main/examples/values.dev-generic.yaml \
    --set fqdn.domain="paralus.local" \
    -n paralus \
    --create-namespace
```

> Note: In case you get an `Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: Kubernetes cluster unreachable` error, you need to set your `kubeconfig` context right. You can do so be running `sudo microk8s.kubectl config view --raw > ~/.kube/config`.

> Note: Since v0.1.9, elasticsearch is an optional component. By default, Paralus will use database (Postgres) as the auditlog storage component. If you're doing a fresh install, below are the values.yaml file that you must pass during installation:

  - Postgres (_default_): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paralus/helm-charts/main/examples/values.dev-generic.yaml
  - Elasticsearch: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paralus/helm-charts/main/examples/values.elasticsearch.yaml

You'll see the following output if the installation succeeds:

```bash
NAME: myrelease
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Jul 28 09:01:27 2022
NAMESPACE: paralus
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
1. Access the application URL by running these commands:
  Open http://console.paralus.local in browser.

You can view the default password for admin@paralus.local by running the following command once all the pods are running:

kubectl logs -f --namespace paralus $(kubectl get pods --namespace paralus -l app.kubernetes.io/name='paralus' -o jsonpath='{ .items[0].metadata.name }') initialize | grep 'Org Admin default password:'
```

> Note: It can take upto a few minutes before all the pods are running and you can access the dashboard. You can check the status using `watch kubectl get pods`

### Configuring /etc/hosts

Since we are deploying Paralus on local cluster, we need to update the `/etc/hosts` file with the IP Address/Ingress Host name to access the dashboard.

In order to do that, we need the IP address of the loadbalancer service that we will use to access Paralus. You can run the following command to get the required details:

```bash
kubectl get service myrelease-contour-envoy -n paralus

NAME                      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE
myrelease-contour-envoy   LoadBalancer   10.152.183.106   192.168.0.200   80:31644/TCP,443:31126/TCP   2m38s

```

Edit the `/etc/hosts` file using your favourite editor and add the following line at the end of it along with the `EXTERNAL-IP` address obtained and save it.

```bash
192.168.0.200 console.paralus.local
```

Open your favorite web browser and navigate to `http://console.paralus.local`, you will be see the dashboard with the login screen

> **Note:** Docker-for-Mac does not expose container networks directly on the macOS host & hence you will not be able to access Paralus dashboard if you're on a Mac machine. We suggest using [docker-mac-net-connect](https://github.com/chipmk/docker-mac-net-connect) utility to overcome this issue.

### Resetting Default Password

Paralus comes configured with default credentials that allow you to access the dashboard.

In order to get the default passowrd, copy the command displayed after helm install and execute it

```bash
kubectl logs -f --namespace paralus $(kubectl get pods --namespace paralus -l app.kubernetes.io/name='paralus' -o jsonpath='{ .items[0].metadata.name }') initialize | grep 'Org Admin default password:'

Org Admin default password: 8[&C2(74^
```

In a new browser window/tab navigate to `http://console.paralus.local` and log in with the following credentials:

- username: `admin@paralus.local` - _or the one you specified in `values.yaml`_
- password: `<generated above>`

It will ask you to change the default password. Please provide new set of passwords to proceed. If successful, you'll be redirected to the projects page where you'll see a default project.

### Importing Existing Cluster

Everything in Paralus is grouped into [Projects](/docs/usage/projects). Each project will have [clusters](/docs/usage/clusters), [users](/docs/usage/users) and [groups](/docs/usage/groups) associated with it. Hence the first step it to create a new project.

Click on **New Project** to create a new project and then import a cluster in that project.

<img src="/img/docs/paralus-import-cluster-1.png" alt="Create New Cluster" height="70%" width="70%"/>

Click **Continue** and download the bootstrap yaml file by clicking **Import Bootstrap YAML**. This will download the YAML file that is required to connect your cluster with Paralus.

<img src="/img/docs/paralus-import-cluster-2.png" alt="Download Bootstrap YAML file" height="70%" width="70%"/>

#### Configuring Network

##### Getting Cluster ID and Hostname

Open the downloaded yaml file in a text editor and look for `clusterID`

```yaml
data:
  clusterID: 5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f
  relays: '[{"token":"cakmpdvjd030q1q53p9g","addr":"console.paralus.local:80","endpoint":"*.core-connector.paralus.local:443","name":"paralus-core-relay-agent","templateToken":"cakl93fjd030q1q53p5g"}]'
```

Note down the `clusterID`

#### Configuring HostAliases

> Note: This step is required only when you're importing microk8s cluster. You can skip to [updating etc/hosts](#configuring-etchosts) if you're importing any different cluster.

As this setup is being done on a local system, a public IP address or a domain is missing. Hence, there's a need to configure `spec.hostAliases` for the relay agent pod in the downloaded yaml file present in the cluster being imported.

To make the configuration changes, you need the `CLUSTER-IP` address of Loadbalancer

Use the command `kubectl get svc -A` and note down the IP address of `<releasename>-contour-envoy`

```bash
$ microk8s kubectl get svc -A
NAMESPACE        NAME                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                         AGE
default          kubernetes                 ClusterIP      10.152.183.1     <none>           443/TCP                         3d19h
kube-system      kube-dns                   ClusterIP      10.152.183.10    <none>           53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP          3d19h
metallb-system   webhook-service            ClusterIP      10.152.183.206   <none>           443/TCP                         3d18h
paralus          myrelease-kratos-courier   ClusterIP      None             <none>           80/TCP                          3d18h

paralus          paralus                    ClusterIP      10.152.183.221   <none>           11000/TCP,10000/TCP,10001/TCP   3d18h
paralus          myrelease-kratos-admin     ClusterIP      10.152.183.187   <none>           80/TCP                          3d18h
paralus          dashboard                  ClusterIP      10.152.183.149   <none>           80/TCP                          3d18h
paralus          prompt                     ClusterIP      10.152.183.65    <none>           7009/TCP                        3d18h
paralus          myrelease-fluent-bit       ClusterIP      10.152.183.121   <none>           2020/TCP                        3d18h
paralus          relay-server               ClusterIP      10.152.183.80    <none>           443/TCP                         3d18h
paralus          myrelease-contour-envoy    LoadBalancer   10.152.183.106   192.168.14.160   80:30600/TCP,443:31855/TCP      3d18h
paralus          myrelease-postgresql       ClusterIP      10.152.183.203   <none>           5432/TCP                        3d18h
paralus          myrelease-contour          ClusterIP      10.152.183.146   <none>           8001/TCP                        3d18h
paralus          myrelease-kratos-public    ClusterIP      10.152.183.64    <none>           80/TCP                          3d18h
```

In this case the `CLUSTER-IP` is 10.152.183.106.

Open the downloaded yaml file and add the following lines under `spec.hostAliases` for `relay-agent` deployment.

```yaml
...
hostAliases:
  - ip: 10.152.183.106
  hostnames:
    - "console.paralus.local"
    - "5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.user.paralus.local"
    - "5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.core-connector.paralus.local"
...
```

##### Updating /etc/hosts

Add two new lines in `/etc/hosts` file along with the IP address obtained and the hostnames. This ensures that the target cluster is able to resolve the hostname and reach the LoadBalancer IP address.

Only when microk8s cluster is imported, we specify the hostAliases, else the local system's /etc/hosts file is enough.

```bash
192.168.0.200 5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.user.paralus.local
192.168.0.200 5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.core-connector.paralus.local
```

Your final `/etc/hosts` file should be something like the following

```bash
192.168.0.200 console.paralus.local
192.168.0.200 5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.user.paralus.local
192.168.0.200 5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.core-connector.paralus.local
```

### Accessing Existing Cluster

With all the changes in place, it's time to apply the bootstrap yaml file that we download while [importing an existing cluster](#importing-an-existing-cluster)

```bash
kubectl apply -f mylocalcluster.yaml
```

Wait for the changes to take place. On the dashboard you will see that the cluster is imported successfully. It usually takes 3-5 minutes for the status to update.

> _You can also execute `kubectl get pods` to check the status._

<img src="/img/docs/paralus-import-cluster-3.png" alt="Import Cluster Success" height="70%" width="70%"/>

#### Using Web Kubectl

At this point, the cluster is successfully imported to Paralus. However, in order to use `kubectl` from the dashboard, we need to configure the `prompt` deplpoyment.

Edit `prompt` deployment using `kubectl edit deployment prompt -n Paralus`. Add the following lines under `spec.hostAliases` to the deployment:

```yaml
...
hostAliases:
  - hostnames:
    - console.paralus.local
    - 5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.user.paralus.local
    - 5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.core-connector.paralus.local
  ip: 10.152.183.106
...
```

Select your newly imported cluster and click on `kubectl` to access the prompt and interact with your cluster from the dashboard.

A `kubectl` console will open in the bottom half of the screen, enter your kubectl commands to interact with your cluster.

<img src="/img/docs/paralus-import-cluster-4.png" alt="Accessing imported cluster via kubectl" height="70%" width="70%"/>

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed Paralus and imported a local cluster on a MicroK8s cluster.
