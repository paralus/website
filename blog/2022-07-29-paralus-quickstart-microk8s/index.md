In the previous blog posts we showed how you can set up Paralus on various cloud based Kubernetes clusters like [Azure](/blog/paralus-quickstart-aks/), [AWS](/blog/eks-quickstart) and [GCP](/blog/paralus-quickstart-gke). We also shared a tutorial on setting up Paralus on a [Kind](/blog/kind-quickstart) cluster.

All these posts have helped people get started with Paralus. However, there have been requests for details on **how to set up Paralus on MicroK8s cluster**. In this blog post, we do exactly that.

<!--truncate-->

In this tutorial we'll show you how to setup Paralus on a local Microk8s clusters along with all the configurations that are required.

## MicroK8s

MicroK8s is a light weight Kubernetes offering for developers, software vendors and DevOps folks. It can run on any system including laptops, servers and IoT devices like Raspberry Pi. It is one of the smallest, fastest & easily configurable Kubernetes offering out there. Refer to [MicroK8s documentation](https://microk8s.io/docs) to know more about it.

### Installing and Configuring MicroK8s

If you don't already have MicroK8s installed on your local system, you can do so by following the [MicroK8s Installation Guide](https://microk8s.io/docs/getting-started).

To check the status of your MicroK8s installation, run the following command:

```bash
microk8s status --wait-ready

microk8s is running
high-availability: no
  datastore master nodes: 127.0.0.1:19001
  datastore standby nodes: none

    storage              # (core) Alias to hostpath-storage add-on, deprecated
```

As mentioned, this is a light weight offering and hence a lot of addons are disabled by default. We need to enable a few of them to be able to run Paralus. In this case we need to enable `dns`, `hostpath-storage` and `metallb`, you can do so by running the enable command:

```bash
sudo microk8s enable dns hostpath-storage

Infer repository core for addon dns
Infer repository core for addon hostpath-storage

Storage will be available soon.

```

While configuring `metabllb` load balancer, it will ask you to provide a range of IP addresses that can be used to serve Paralus. So based on the IP address range provided by your DHCP server, you can provide the IP addresses accordingly.

```bash
sudo microk8s enable metallb

Infer repository core for addon metallb
Enabling MetalLB
Enter each IP address range delimited by comma (e.g. '10.64.140.43-10.64.140.49,192.168.0.105-192.168.0.111'): 192.168.0.200-192.168.0.210

```

> Note: The above IP address range that is provided is for sandbox/local environment only. For a production setup, you will need valid IP addresses for metallb to work correctly.

At this point, you have successfully configured MicroK8s and can proceed to install Paralus

### Installing Paralus

Add the [paralus helm repository](https://github.com/paralus/helm-charts)

```bash
helm repo add paralus https://paralus.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

```bash
   helm install myrelease paralus/ztka \
    -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paralus/helm-charts/main/examples/values.dev-generic.yaml \
    --set fqdn.domain="paralus.local" \
    -n paralus \
    --create-namespace
```

> Note: In case you get an `Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: Kubernetes cluster unreachable` error, you need to set your `kubeconfig` context right. You can do so be running `sudo microk8s.kubectl config view --raw > ~/.kube/config`.

You'll see the following output if the installation succeeds:

```bash
NAME: myrelease
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Jul 28 09:01:27 2022
NAMESPACE: paralus
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
1. Access the application URL by running these commands:
  Open http://console.paralus.local in browser.

You can view the recovery link for admin user by running the following command once all the pods are running:

kubectl logs -f --namespace paralus $(kubectl get pods --namespace paralus -l app.kubernetes.io/name='paralus' -o jsonpath='{ .items[0].metadata.name }') initialize | grep 'Org Admin signup URL:'
```

> Note: It can take upto a few minutes before all the pods are running and you can access the dashboard. You can check the status using `watch kubectl get pods`

### Configuring /etc/hosts

Since we are deploying Paralus on local cluster, we need to update the `/etc/hosts` file with the IP Address/Ingress Host name to access the dashboard.

In order to do that, we need the IP address of the loadbalancer service that we will use to access Paralus. You can run the following command to get the required details:

```bash
kubectl get service myrelease-contour-envoy -n paralus

NAME                      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE
myrelease-contour-envoy   LoadBalancer   10.152.183.49   192.168.0.200   80:31644/TCP,443:31126/TCP   2m38s

```

Edit the `/etc/hosts` file using your favourite editor and add the following line at the end of it along with the `EXTERNAL-IP` address obtained and save it.

```bash
192.168.0.200 console.paralus.local
```

Open your favorite web browser and navigate to `http://console.paralus.local`, you will be see the dashboard with the login screen

### Resetting Default Password

Paralus comes configured with default credentials that allow you to access the dashboard.

In order to get the `Password Reset URL`, copy the command displayed after helm install and execute it

```bash
kubectl logs -f --namespace paralus $(kubectl get pods --namespace paralus -l app.kubernetes.io/name='paralus' -o jsonpath='{ .items[0].metadata.name }') initialize | grep 'Org Admin signup URL:'

Org Admin signup URL:  http://console.paralus.local/self-service/recovery?flow=9ec13c6f-414e-4cb5-bf4c-def35973118f&token=ge6bi6zmyzUlQrHlYTOCDeItV82hT08Y
```

> **Note:** The password recovery link generated while deploying Paralus is valid only for `10 minutes`. For any reason if the link is expired, refer to our [troubleshooting guide](../docs/references/troubleshooting) to re-generate the password reset link.

Access the URL in a browser, and provide a new password.

### Accessing Paralus Dashboard

In a new browser window/tab navigate to `http://console.paralus.local` and log in with the following credentials:

- username: `admin@paralus.local` - _or the one you specified in `values.yaml`_
- password: `<The one you entered in the earlier section>`

You'll be taken to the projects page where you'll see a default project.

<img src="/img/docs/paralus-dashboard.png" alt="Paralus default project screen" height="70%" width="70%"/>

### Importing Existing Cluster

Everything in Paralus is grouped into [Projects](/docs/usage/projects). Each project will have [clusters](/docs/usage/clusters), [users](/docs/usage/users) and [groups](/docs/usage/groups) associated with it. Hence the first step it to create a new project.

Click on **New Project** to create a new project and then import a cluster in that project.

<img src="/img/docs/paralus-import-cluster-1.png" alt="Create New Cluster" height="70%" width="70%"/>

Click **Continue** and download the bootstrap yaml file by clicking **Import Bootstrap YAML**. This will download the YAML file that is required to connect your cluster with Paralus.

<img src="/img/docs/paralus-import-cluster-2.png" alt="Download Bootstrap YAML file" height="70%" width="70%"/>

#### Configuring Network

##### Getting Cluster ID and Hostname

Open the downloaded yaml file in a text editor and look for `clusterID`

```yaml
data:
  clusterID: 5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f
  relays: '[{"token":"cakmpdvjd030q1q53p9g","addr":"console.paralus.local:80","endpoint":"*.core-connector.paralus.local:443","name":"paralus-core-relay-agent","templateToken":"cakl93fjd030q1q53p5g"}]'
```

With the `clusterID` identified, we need to update the hosts file. This becuase we are using hostname to route traffic.

```bash
5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.user.paralus.local
5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.core-connector.paralus.local
```

##### Updating /etc/hosts

Add two new lines in `/etc/hosts` file along with the IP address obtained

```bash
192.168.0.200 5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.user.paralus.local
192.168.0.200 5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.core-connector.paralus.local
```

Your final `/etc/hosts` file should be something like the following

```bash
192.168.0.200 console.paralus.local
192.168.0.200 5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.user.paralus.local
192.168.0.200 5dceca49-c6cd-4a2b-b65a-f193c4fa001f.core-connector.paralus.local
```

### Accessing Existing Cluster

With all the changes in place, it's time to apply the bootstrap yaml file that we download while [importing an existing cluster](#importing-an-existing-cluster)

```bash
kubectl apply -f mylocalcluster.yaml
```

Wait for the changes to take place. On the dashboard you will see that the cluster is imported successfully. It usually takes 3-5 minutes for the status to update.

> _You can also execute `kubectl get pods` to check the status._

<img src="/img/docs/paralus-import-cluster-3.png" alt="Import Cluster Success" height="70%" width="70%"/>

Select your newly imported cluster and click on `kubectl` to access the prompt and interact with your cluster from the dashboard.

A `kubectl` console will open in the bottom half of the screen, enter your kubectl commands to interact with your cluster.

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed Paralus and imported a local cluster on a MicroK8s cluster.
