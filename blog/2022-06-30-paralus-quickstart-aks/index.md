The [previous blog post](/blog/eks-quickstart), was about deploying Paralus to Amazon's Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

In this blog post, we'll take you through the steps to setup an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster on a custom domain and deploy Paralus on it.

## Pre Requisites

To setup Paralus on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) there are a few prerequisites:

- An Azure Account - _you can [register for a Free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/) if you don't have one_
- A Domain Name - _with permission to manage DNS settings._
- Helm

The logical steps would start with setting up a Kubernetes cluster on AKS. Deploying Paralus via helm charts followed by configuring DNS for your domain to work with Paralus. Lastly, logging into Paralus and importing a Kubernetes cluster.

## Creating AKS Cluster

One of the good things when it comes to creating an AKS cluster is the various options it gives you to create a cluster:

- [Using the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli)
- [Using the Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell)
- [Using the Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell)
- [Using the ARM template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-rm-template)

You are free to choose any option that you want, we used the Azure Portal to create one.

> Note: Choose a virtual machine with atleast 4 vCPUs and 16 GB of RAM. Refer to the list of [Azure VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/).

After the cluster is created, start the cluster and connect to it. If you've created a cluster using the Azure portal, you can use the Azure Cloud Shell to connect to the cluster.

## Installing Paralus

1. Add helm repo

   `helm repo add paralus https://paralus.github.io/helm-charts`

2. Install Paralus

  ```bash
   helm install myrelease paralus/ztka \
    -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paralus/helm-charts/main/examples/values.dev-generic.yaml \
    --set fqdn.domain="chartexample.com" \
    -n paralus \
    --create-namespace
  ```

  >**Note:** If you're installing this in a **production environment**, please use [values.yaml](https://github.com/paralus/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/ztka/values.yaml) and configure the values mentioned [here](https://github.com/paralus/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/ztka#values) as required.

  ```bash
   NAME: myrelease
   LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Jun 29 10:13:48 2022
   NAMESPACE: paralus
   STATUS: deployed
   REVISION: 1
   NOTES:
   1. Access the application URL by running these commands:
     Get load balancer address via:
     kubectl get service envoy --namespace paralus -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'

     Add DNS records of following domains such that it resolves to above address:
     - console.chartexample.com
     - *.core-connector.chartexample.com
     - *.user.chartexample.com
     Open http://console.chartexample.com in browser.

   You can view the recovery link for admin user by running the following command once all the pods are running:

   kubectl logs -f --namespace paralus $(kubectl get pods --namespace paralus -l app.kubernetes.io/name='paralus' -o jsonpath='{ .items[0].metadata.name }') initialize | grep 'Org Admin signup URL:'
  ```

> Note: It can take upto a few minutes before all the pods are running and you can access the dashboard. You can check the status using `watch kubectl get pods`

## Configuring DNS Settings

Once the installation is complete, you need to first get the external IP address provided by Azure loadbalancer. You can do so by executing the following command:

```bash
kubectl get svc myrelease-contour-envoy -n paralus

NAME                            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                         AGE
myrelease-contour-envoy         LoadBalancer   10.0.33.6      13.71.51.105   80:30193/TCP,443:30873/TCP      3m13s   
```

Note down the `EXTERNAL-IP` address for the `<releasename>-contour-envoy` service.

Navigate to your domain's DNS setting page. _The steps for changing DNS settings will vary based on your domain name provider._

While you are on your DNS Setting page, for the selected domain name, you need to add three A records. These will be based on the subdomains provided in the notes section post installation.

| Type | Address | Resolves To | TTL |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | console.chartexample.com | 13.71.51.105 | 1 Hour |
| A | *.core-connector.chartexample.com | 13.71.51.105 | 1 Hour |
| A | *.user.chartexample.com | 13.71.51.105 | 1 Hour |

### Accessing The Dashboard

Paralus is installed with a default organization and an admin user. Hence, after installation, you need to set a password for the user. To do so, execute the command that you get after installing Paralus.

```bash
kubectl logs -f --namespace paralus $(kubectl get pods --namespace paralus -l app.kubernetes.io/name='paralus' -o jsonpath='{ .items[0].metadata.name }') initialize | grep 'Org Admin signup URL:'

Org Admin signup URL:  http://console.chartexample.com/self-service/recovery?flow=de34efa4-934e-4916-8d3f-a1c6ce65ba39&token=IYJFI5vbORhGnz81gCjK7kucDVoiuQ7j

```

> **Note:** The password recovery link generated while deploying Paralus is valid only for `10 minutes`. For any reason if the link is expired, refer to our [troubleshooting guide](../docs/references/troubleshooting) to re-generate the password reset link.

Access the URL in a browser, and provide a new password. In a new browser window/tab navigate to `http://console.chartexample.com` and log in with the following credentials:

- username: `admin@paralus.local` - _or the one you specified in `values.yaml`_
- password: `<The one you entered above>`

You'll be taken to the projects page where you'll see a default project.

### Importing Existing Cluster

Everything in Paralus is grouped into [Projects](/docs/usage/projects). Each project will have [clusters](/docs/usage/clusters), [users](/docs/usage/users) and [groups](/docs/usage/groups) associated with it. Hence the first step it to create a new project.

Click on **New Project** to create a new project and then import a cluster in that project. The cluster we are importing is a minikube cluster hosted on my laptop.

Click **Continue** and download the bootstrap yaml file by clicking **Import Bootstrap YAML**. This will download the YAML file that is required to connect your cluster with Paralus.

Apply the bootstrap configuration yaml file

```bash
kubectl apply -f mylocalcluster.yaml
```

Wait for the changes to take place. On the dashboard you will see that the cluster is imported successfully. It usually takes 3-5 minutes for the status to update.

Select your newly imported cluster and click on `kubectl` to access the prompt and interact with your cluster from the dashboard.

A `kubectl` console will open in the bottom half of the screen, enter your kubectl commands to interact with your cluster.

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed Paralus on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and imported a local cluster.
